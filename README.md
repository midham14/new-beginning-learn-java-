<summary><strong>📅 Day 1 — Java Foundations</strong></summary>

## 🎯 Goal
Understand how Java works, set up the development environment, and run the first Java program.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 How Java Works
- Difference between **JDK**, **JRE**, and **JVM**
- Java compilation process (`.java → .class → JVM`)
- Why Java is platform-independent

---

### 🔹 Environment Setup
- Installed **Java JDK (23.0.2)**
- Verified installation:
  ```bash
  java -version
  javac -version

  🔹 Variables & Types

Difference between primitive and reference types

Why Java is strictly typed

Where variables should be declared

🔹 Strings & Memory

String is an object, not a primitive

Strings are immutable

Difference between:

"" → String

'' → char

Basic memory concepts (stack vs heap)

🔹 Operators & Comparisons

Arithmetic operators (+ - * / %)

Comparison operators (== != > <)

No implicit truthy/falsy values like JavaScript

Why == is safe for primitives in Java

🔹 Type Casting

Java does not guess types

Explicit casting is required

Prevents silent bugs common in JavaScript

🔹 Java vs JavaScript (Early Comparison)

No free functions — everything is inside a class

No dynamic properties

No implicit coercion

More verbosity, more safety

⚠️ Key Takeaways

Java enforces correctness at compile time

Errors appear early, not at runtime

Java code is predictable and maintainable
